# Folder-Copy-and-Paste-Program
This simple program allows you to copy any file and paste it as another automatically. This operation can be run daily. (Working on making selected dates)

## _Installation instructions(Windows Only)_ 

First head over to the `Releases tab` and look for the latest release, or click this [Link](https://github.com/VolcanicMG/File-Copy-and-Paste-Program/releases). Once you download the zip folder, open it, and double click the `setup.exe` file. From that point out, the program will ask you a few questions and get on its way installing.

### FOR NEWER RELEASES
For newer releases `V0.0.3.2+`, all you need to do is download the `msi` file from the release page and run it. 

`Make sure you have .NET 4.7.2 framework installed (If not the program should install it for you or ask to do so)`
